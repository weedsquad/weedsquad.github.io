Weed Squad is a Turkish CTF team. It was started its adventure in early 2016. We are trying to participate all local CTFs. Our all team members are working as security researcher and software developer. <br>We have lots of areas of interest like web app sec, network sec, reverse engineering, forensics, cryptography, wifi security, malware analysis & malware development. We also love coding some security tools and developing exploits. Our team always publish write-ups about CTFs we participated.


P.S: When we participate a CTF, just look TOP 3 teams! Watch us while WE are pwning whole CTF !
